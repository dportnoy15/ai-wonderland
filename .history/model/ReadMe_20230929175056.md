1. install Blender and copy the location where you install the Blender
    * in most cases it should be C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 'x.x'(the version of the blender)
2. Use CML to cd to the location above, and run:
    blender --background --python C: (...)\ai-wonderland\model\format.py
    *(...) means where you clone the github repo

if we want to integrate this into generate-model.py, we probably need subprocess
